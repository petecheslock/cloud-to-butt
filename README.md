Sysadmin To Sysadmin Plugin
=============

Chrome extension that replaces occurrences of 'DevOps' with 'sysadmin'.

Forked from https://github.com/hank/cloud-to-butt

This plugin lowers my blood pressure when people say 'DevOps' but really mean 'sysadmin'

I'm looking at you rackspace:  www.rackspace.com/devops/

Installation
------------

In Chrome, choose Window > Extensions.  Drag DevopsToSysadmin.crx into the page that appears.
